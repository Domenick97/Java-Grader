# Java Grader

Quick program I wrote to scan through students homework assignments for the specific assignments they were to complete. It then outputs their grade based on how many of the assignments they submitted and feedback of which ones they were missing.

## Grading

### First:

    Add the assignment names into the input boxes on the left side.

> The assignment names are case sensitive and need to be copied exactly as they are on Practice It.

### For each student:

    1. Open Homework.pdf
    
    2. Copy all of the information from the pdf into the large text area on the right side.
    
    3. Then click "Grade"
    
    4. Copy grade and auto-generated comments for missing assignments at the bottom into the grading system.
