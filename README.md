# Java Grader

Quick program I wrote to scan through students homework assignments for the specific assignments they were to complete. It then outputs their grade based on how many of the assignments they submitted and feedback of which ones they were missing.

## Grading

### First:

    Add the assignment names into the input boxes on the left side.

> The assignment names are case sensitive and need to be copied exactly as they are on Practice It.

### For each student:

    1. Open Homework.pdf
    
    2. Copy all of the information from the pdf into the large text area.
    
    3. Then click "Grade"
    
    4. Copy grade and auto-generated comments for missing assignments at the bottom into the grading system.
    
    (Optional)
    
    5. Click "Clear" to clear the last students input and grade.
    
## Features

### Clear

The Clear button clears just the input text area and output to reduce mixing up grades between students.

<b>Note:</b> The assignment names are not cleared.


### Non-Unicode Characters

The program will filter out non-Unicode characters from the input when the user clicks the grade button.

> The assignment names can not include non-Unicode characters.
