# Java Grader

Quick program I wrote to scan through students homework assignments for specific assignments they were to submit. It then outputs their grade based on how many of the assignments they submitted and feedback of which ones they were missing.

## Grading

First:

    Add the assignment names to the array 'assignment' in 'Homework.java'
    Compile 'Homework.java'

For each student:

    Copy list of assignments from PDF to file 'HW-student.txt'
    Run 'Homework'
